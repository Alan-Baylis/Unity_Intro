# Unity_Intro
A procedural planet / star generator. TH KÃ¶ln, course PGVW

After one week introduction to Unity and procedural generation we had 3 days to implement our own procedural generator.

[Windows release](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/releases/tag/v1.0)

It takes a moment to generate something, and  the screen will freeze the time it takes (unity functions can't be used parallel and I did not know when I stated work). Anyway the assert is more that kind that you use in the editor, so I left it so.
